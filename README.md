Stream Send Website
===================

Description: A site template for Stream Send built from a PSD.

Note: The styles follow BEM guidelines. The SASS folder resembles SMACSS arcitecture.
In addition, webpack is used as a bundler to bundle scripts/css.  As a result,
the css is rendered into the head of the document (allowing for one less server
request) and the JS scripts are packed.
